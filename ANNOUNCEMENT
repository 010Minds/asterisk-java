ANNOUNCEMENT: Asterisk-Java 0.3 released

Asterisk-Java 0.3, a Java library for Asterisk PBX integration,
has been released.

The Asterisk-Java package consists of a set of Java classes that allow
you to easily build Java applications that interact with an Asterisk
PBX Server. Asterisk-Java supports both interfaces that Asterisk 
provides for this scenario: The FastAGI protocol and the Manager API.

Asterisk-Java 0.3 is the new stable release with full support for
Asterisk 1.4 and the new Live API (org.asteriskjava.live).
The Live API takes care of the lowlevel action and event handling
of the Manager API and offers an intuitive API for Java developers.
Asterisk-Java takes advantage of the features of Java 5.0 and therfore
requires a Java Virtual Machine of at least version 1.5.0.

Asterisk-Java is used in several commercial environments and by
the following Open Source projects:
