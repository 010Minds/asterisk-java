			<subsection name="What is Asterisk-Java?">
				<p>The Asterisk-Java package consists of a set of Java classes 
					that allow you to easily build Java applications that interact with an <a 
					href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk PBX Server</a>. Asterisk-java
					supports both interfaces that Asterisk provides for this scenario:
					The <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+AGI">FastAGI</a>
					protocol and the <a 
					href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+manager+API">Manager API</a>.<br/>
					Asterisk-Java is compatible with Asterisk 1.0 and 1.2.</p>
				<p>The FastAGI implementation supports all <a 
					href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/command/package-summary.html">commands</a> 
					currently available from Asterisk.</p>
				<p>The Manager API implementation supports receiving events from the Asterisk 
					server (e.g. call progess, registered peers, channel state) and sending 
					actions to Asterisk (e.g. originate call, agent 
					login/logoff, start/stop voice recording).</p>
				<p>A complete list of the available <a 
					href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/manager/event/package-summary.html">events</a> 
					and <a 
					href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/manager/action/package-summary.html">actions</a> 
					is available in the <a 
					href="apidocs/index.html">javadocs</a>.</p>

			<subsection name="Status">
				<p>Asterisk-Java 0.2 has been released in late november and is 
					available from the <a 
					href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-java/">sourceforge 
					project page</a>.</p>
				<p>Ideas for the future include a stateful higher level API 
					that supports operations like "get list of currently active 
					calls" or "place call" with objects like "Call" or 
					"Channel" that are transparently updated as the state of 
					the corresponding object within the asterisk server 
					changes. An option is to provide an implementation of the
					<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jtapi/">Java 
					Telephony API (JTAPI)</a> based on the
					<a href="http://gjtapi.sourceforge.net/">Generic JTAPI and 
					JCC Project (GJTAPI)</a>.</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Download">
				<p>Official releases and release candidates are available on the <a 
					href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-java/">sourceforge 
					project page</a>.</p>
				<p>You can also download a 
					<a href="http://maven.reucon.com/maven/org.asteriskjava/distributions/">snapshot</a>.</p>
				<p>Please feel free to provide any feedback or ask for support via the
					<a href="mail-lists.html">Asterisk-Java user's mailing list</a>.</p>
				<p>Asterisk-Java is also available via cvs from sourcforge:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/asterisk-java login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/asterisk-java co asterisk-java
]]></source>
				<p>When prompted for a password for <i>anonymous</i>, simply 
					press the Enter key.</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Requirements">
				<p>At runtime Asterisk-Java requires a Java Runtime 
					Environment (JRE) of at least version 1.4. It has
					been successfully tested on Sun's JVM and Bea's JRockit.</p>
				<p>Of course you also need a working Asterisk server. When 
					using the Manager API be sure that it has been enabled (see
					<a href="http://www.voip-info.org/tiki-index.php?page=Asterisk%20config%20manager.conf">Asterisk config manager.conf</a>).</p>
				<p>For logging Asterisk-Java will use 
					<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a> when
					available. If you do not include log4j in your Classpath 
					Asterisk-Java will use java.util.logging.</p>
				<p>If you choose to compile Asterisk-Java on your own you need a
					Java Developer Kit (JDK) of at least version 1.4. To run the unit
					tests you need <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> and
					<a href="http://www.easymock.org/">EasyMock</a> in addition.</p>

			<subsection name="Related Projects">
				<p><a href="http://adm.hamnett.org/">Asterisk Desktop Manager</a>, or
					ADM for short, brings the power of Asterisk to the user's desktop. It
					is written in Java, uses the Eclipse SWT library for its GUI and 
					Asterisk-Java to provide Asterisk connectivity.<br/>
					Available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
				<p><a href="http://jivesoftware.org/asterisk-im/">Asterisk-IM</a> is a plugin
					for the Jive Messenger XMPP (jabber) server. It provides integrated 
					presence between your IM client and phone, notification of incoming calls by IM
					and originate calls from the IM client - and of course it is based on
					Asterisk-Java.<br/>
					Available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
				<p><a href="http://asterfax.sourceforge.net/">AsterFax</a> provides an 
				    SMTP Fax gateway for the transmission of faxes using Asterisk and
				    is based on Asterisk-Java.<br/>
					Available under a modified GNU General Public License
					(Organizations with more than one fax lines must purchase a 
					commercial licence).</p>
				<p><a href="http://asterisk-jtapi.sourceforge.net/">Asterisk-JTAPI</a>
					is a JTAPI implementation for the Asterisk software PBX system. JTAPI is 
					a provider independent programming interface for Java to build applications 
					for computer telephony or to add support for it. JTAPI covers a wide range 
					of usage scenarios starting from controlling a single telephone to a 
					whole PBX system for example in call-centers.<br/>
                    Asterisk-JTAPI builds on top of two other projects: Asterisk-Java, which 
					provides a Java interface to the Asterisk Manager API, and GJTAPI, which 
					provides a general framework for JTAPI interfaces.<br/>
				    Available under Apache License.</p>

					Framework and anything else that implements the basic 
					portions of the framework. It currently only supports the Manager API and
					is based on a pre-0.1 snapshot of Asterisk-Java.<br/>
					Available under Apache License.</p>

					Middleware based on the
					<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jain/article_slee_principles.html">JAIN SLEE</a>
					standard. It includes an
					<a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/MobicentsAsteriskRA">Asterisk RA</a>
					that is based on Asterisk-Java.<br/>

				<p><a href="http://tanesha.net/Wiki/JastAgi.html">Jast Agi</a> 
					is another toolkit for writing Java applications that connect to
					Asterisk using the FastAGI protocol. The lastest version introduces
					a statemachine approach to handle AGI requests and uses java.nio to

				<p><a href="http://orderlycalls.sourceforge.net/">OrderlyCalls</a>
					has replaced
					<a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-JAGIServer">JAGIServer</a>
					and supports writing Java based AGI Scripts using FastAGI. Support 
					for the Manager API was recently added.<br/>
					Available under a modified Lesser GNU General Public License
					(It is prohibited to use it for automating 'cold-calling' and you
					need prior written permission to provide or augment call queuing).</p>
				<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasterisk/">JAsterisk</a> 
					is a set of JNI classes providing direct access to Asterisk 
					PBX functionality from Java. It is not a socket-level 
					interface to Asterisk (like Asterisk-Java) but a true Java-Asterisk 
					integration at the Thread level.<br/>
